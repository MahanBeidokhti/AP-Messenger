Thanks to the authors ;) Working with messenger is so easy

First things first, you have to go in to your account (if you don't have one, you can create one with "sign up" button. 

Then you can do anything you want with the messenger

1- sending message to : 1) other users
                                  2) group you're joined
                                  3) channels you've created 
2- creating channels and groups or joining to them
3- getting list of users/groups/channels you've chatted

Sometimes you don't have access to the internet but you want to Chack your messages, so we added the future that you can open your chats in offline mode. 
To use it, simply go to send message when you are offline

Also you can simply logout from your account and create or login to another account
